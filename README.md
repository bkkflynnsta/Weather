The Weather app for iOS is a practice project introducing learners to SwiftUI
concepts, structures, and approaches.  I highly recommend this course for
beginner to intermediate Apple developers, especially those new to SwiftUI.

Sean Allen does a commendable job introducing the language, covering pros and
cons of SwiftUI, and provides solid, experience-backed tutorial on using the
most popular features of SwiftUI to build great looking apps and easily-readable
code.

This is my own customized result based on Sean's code, with some challenges
accepted to extend the functionality of the Weather app, including:

- Moving hard-coded data into structs to abstract the data for future "real"
API-acquired content
- Adding a TabView to display multiple City weather forecasts in swipable tabs
- Adding a horizontally-scrollable section for a 14-day forecast per city

Please feel free to clone or fork this project - I think there's a lot of room
for improvement

Enjoy!
